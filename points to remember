1-user story- as a ....i want to....so that....

2-key features-
*all features from the simple level


3-acceptance criteria-
*The system should display (a list of food items with prices. )
*The user must be able to (add multiple food items to the cart.)

4-story points- 3/5/9

5-crud operation,
complexity,complex backend  logic,AI driven
5-complexity and justification (examples)-
•feature involves basic crud operations making it relatively straightforward
•adding (any function)(example...price drop notification) introduce slight complexity due to the backend logic requirement
•this level introduce more dynamic interaction such as multiple wishlist,priority maangement...
so...backend requires more complex logic for personalised recommendations& stock alrlerts increasing complexity
•this level involves AI-driven recommendations, automation of purchases, and social media integration,
making it significantly complex. Machine learning models, real-time price tracking, and automated purchasing workflows require intricate backend logic,
making it a high-effort feature.
